# Arithmetic Formatter

This is the first project out of five that I completed as part of the 'Scientific Computing with Python' course from freeCodeCamp. For this project, I worked on Replit using their test code to develop a function. The function takes a list of arithmetic problems as input and arranges them vertically and side-by-side. Additionally, the function has the capability to accept an optional second argument (a boolean). When the argument is set to True, the answers to the arithmetic problems are displayed.
